# Laravel Artisan MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables secure execution of Laravel Artisan commands through Claude and other MCP clients. This server acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your **local** Laravel applications, allowing controlled management of Laravel projects through natural language conversations.

## Features

- Access a single directory containing a Laravel project
- Automatically locate PHP on your system
- Execute only whitelisted Artisan commands
- View all available Artisan commands
- Secure by design with robust input validation

## Examples

![Example](https://github.com/diggy/laravel-artisan-mcp/raw/main/images/example.jpg)

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Laravel project with Artisan CLI
- PHP installed and accessible in your PATH
- MCP-compatible client (such as Claude Desktop)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diggy/laravel-artisan-mcp.git
   cd laravel-artisan-mcp
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv init
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv add "mcp[cli]"
   ```

## Configuration

The server requires the following environment variables:

- `ARTISAN_DIRECTORY`: Absolute path to the Laravel project containing the Artisan executable
- `WHITELISTED_COMMANDS`: Comma-separated list of allowed Artisan commands (e.g., `route:list,cache:clear,make:controller` or any default or custom Commands registered in your Laravel application)

You can provide these variables in several ways:

1. Directly in the command line:
   ```bash
   ARTISAN_DIRECTORY="/absolute/path/to/your/laravel/project" WHITELISTED_COMMANDS="route:list,cache:clear,make:controller" uv run artisan_mcp_server.py
   ```

2. Using a `.env` file:
   ```
   ARTISAN_DIRECTORY=/absolute/path/to/your/laravel/project
   WHITELISTED_COMMANDS=route:list,cache:clear,make:controller
   ```

3. In the Claude Desktop configuration (cf. section on Claude Integration below)

## Testing with MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector provides a graphical interface for testing your server before integrating it with Claude:

```bash
# Run with direct environment variables
ARTISAN_DIRECTORY="/absolute/path/to/your/laravel/project" WHITELISTED_COMMANDS="route:list,cache:clear,make:controller" uv run mcp dev artisan_mcp_server.py

# Or using an env file
uv run mcp dev artisan_mcp_server.py --env-file .env
```

Once the Inspector is running:

1. Open the web interface at http://localhost:5173
2. Explore the "Resources" tab to see available resources
3. Test the tools under the "Tools" tab:
   - `list_all_artisan_commands`: Shows all commands in your Laravel project
   - `run_artisan`: Executes a specific command (must be whitelisted)

## Claude Integration

To use this server with Claude Desktop:

1. Ensure Claude Desktop is installed

2. Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:

   **macOS**:
   ```bash
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   **Windows**:
   ```powershell
   notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. Add the following configuration (adjust paths as needed):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "laravel-artisan": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory", 
           "/absolute/path/to/laravel-artisan-mcp",
           "run", 
           "artisan_mcp_server.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "ARTISAN_DIRECTORY": "/absolute/path/to/your/laravel/project",
           "WHITELISTED_COMMANDS": "route:list,cache:clear,make:controller"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Restart Claude Desktop

## Available Tools

### `run_artisan`

Executes a whitelisted Artisan command.

**Parameters:**
- `command`: The Artisan command to run (e.g., 'cache:clear')

**Example usage in Claude:**
"Run the route:list command to show all available routes in my Laravel app."

### `list_all_artisan_commands`

Displays all available Artisan commands in the Laravel application.

**Example usage in Claude:**
"Show me all available Artisan commands in my Laravel project."

## Available Resources

### `artisan://commands`

Returns a list of all whitelisted commands configured for the server.

**Example usage in Claude:**
"What Artisan commands can I use through you?"

## Security Considerations

This server implements several security measures (according to Claude):

- **Directory Isolation**: Only accesses the explicitly configured Laravel directory
- **Command Whitelisting**: Only executes commands that are specifically allowed
- **Input Validation**: Verifies all inputs before execution
- **Error Handling**: Prevents sensitive information leakage

## Troubleshooting

### "ARTISAN_DIRECTORY must be provided in configuration"

The server cannot find the path to your Laravel project. Check that:
- The environment variable is properly set
- The directory exists and is accessible

### "Artisan not found at: /path/to/artisan"

The specified directory does not contain the Artisan executable. Verify that:
- The path points to a valid Laravel project directory
- The Artisan file exists and has executable permissions

### "PHP executable not found"

The server cannot find PHP in your PATH. Ensure that:
- PHP is installed on your system
- The PHP executable is in your system PATH
